The School Management System is designed to streamline and manage data related to students, teachers, and staff in an educational institution. The system facilitates efficient record-keeping and attendance management, allowing administrators to add, modify, and delete records. Teachers can record student attendance and grades, while students can access their performance details. This project leverages Java for backend development, providing a secure and user-friendly interface for different user roles, including admin, student, teacher, and staff.
